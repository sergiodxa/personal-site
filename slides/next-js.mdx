## Universal React.js made Easy and Simple

---

## Features

---

## File-System Routing

> Each file inside a `pages` folder is its own route, as in the old PHP days.

```file-tree
[
  {
    "type": "folder",
    "name": "pages",
    "children": [
      { "type": "file", "name": "index.js" },
      { "type": "file", "name": "about.js" }
    ]
  },
  { "type": "file", "name": "next.config.js" },
  { "type": "file", "name": "package.json" }
]
```

---

## Automatic Code Splitting

> Each page generates its own JavaScript bundle with only the required code for such page.

---

## Server-Side Rendering

> The first access to the application will be _rendered Server-Side_ to HTML.

---

## AMP Support

> With a simple High Order Component you can make a page render AMP-only content

> or hybrid that supports normal HTML and AMP for SEO improvement.

---

## Single Page Application

> Subsequent page navigation will happen _Client-Side_, requesting

> the JavaScript bundle of the new page on-demand.

---

## Powerful Pre-fetching Capabilities

> You have full control of what pages to pre-fetch in order to

> improve Client-Side navigation times.

---

## Static Exporting

> If the application is simple enough, you can _export to static HTML_

> on build-time instead of running a Node.js application.

---

## CSS in JS

> It comes with an awesome CSS in JS solution called **styled-jsx** already bundled.

> In case you prefer a different one, (e.g. _Emotion_, _Styled Component_, _CSS Modules_, etc.)

> you can still use them and styled-jsx is not included in the final bundles.

---

## Zero Setup

> It has a few conventions (e.g. pages for routes) and abstracts

> you away from the configuration.

---

## Fully Extensible

> Yet it's fully configurable without ejecting as CRA,

> just extend the webpack or Babel configuration as you want when you need it.

---

## Initial data fetching with `getInitialProps`

> A new life cycle method `getInitialProps` is added,

> it lets you fetch data before rendering a page, either server or client side.

---

## Merging Application with Zones

> Next.js Zones allows you to create multiple Next.js applications

> running independently and to connect them as a single application

> when running in production under the same domain.

---

## Serverless Ready

> It can output each page as its own Node.js HTTP request listener

> to be used in a Serverless environment, specially ZEIT Now.sh

---

## Examples for Everything

> The GitHub repository has almost 200 examples for using Next.js including:

- Authentication
- Custom Servers & Complex Routing
- Desktop Applications with Electron
- Server Side Rendering Cache
- Redux, and similar tools, integration (not required with Next.js IMO)
- Styled Components, Emotion, CSS Modules, SASS, LESS and more CSS solutions

## Example Time

## Who's using it Next.js?

> A surprisingly large amount of companies are using Next.js in production right now.

- ZEIT (the creators)
- Marvel Comics
- Invision
- Nike
- Hulu
- TicketMaster
- Open Collective
- Twitch
