At ▲ZEIT [we are launching](https://zeit.co/blog/api-2) our newly renewed
[API documentation](https://zeit.co/api), I've been working on that project
since the ZDB in charge of writing the documentation plus some code related to
it. Documenting our whole public API help me learn and understand more about our
infrastructure and how Now works internally.

And after months working on it I want to share some thinks I learned.

## Document Your Code

This is really important, you need to document your code as completely as
possible. I'm not saying you need to add a comment for each line of code but if
you're doing an HTTP microservice add a README to your repository with a simple
description of each endpoint, what it receives as request and how it looks the
response.

```markdown
## GET /teams/:id/members

Get the list of members of the team `:id`.

### Response

- `uid` (`String`) The team member unique identifier
- `role` (`String`) The role inside the team, it could be OWNER or MEMBER
- `email` (`String`) The email address of the team member
- `username` (`String`) The username of the team member
```

Something simple like that could be enough. As a developer I found that a really
good way to start a project like a library or an HTTP service is with the public
API, create the README, wrote how the project should be used and then code it,
this is what's called
[RDD](https://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html).

If you care about other people and specially about the guy in charge of
documenting your code please do this.

## Errors Are Important

Nobody likes errors, but we all have them. No one can't expect the users of an
API will always use it fine and never face an error. They'll, most often than
you think and is your job while documenting to explain what are the possible
errors, how they look like and a possible solution.

This could make a big difference because if you do it you're giving the user the
power to easily search any error and get the solution, that means less headaches
for the user and less support work for the company.

This also means you need to define a standard way to send errors to the user,
you can't only send status code for some errors and a JSON for others. It
**must** be standardized in order to explain how to read an error.

### [Addressable Errors](https://rauchg.com/2016/addressable-errors)

In a single error message, doesn't matter the format, there's always a limit on
how much is possible to explain, That's the reason we always end up seaching the
exact error message on Google again and again.

Help you and your users and attach a single unique URL to each error and explain
as much as possible what the error means, the reasons to see it and possible
solution.

Bonus point, make it open source, that way people could improve it overtime, if
you ever wrote PHP you may see his docs are full of useful comments from other
developers which most of the time help you understand some feature faster.

## Try, Everything

You may be tempted to write the docs without testing it, in most cases it could
work and everyone will be happy, in other cases it will not work, you may have a
typo on your docs, the README could be outdated or maybe you misunderstood the
code.

That's why you need a way to try every possible case for the API, in an HTTP
based API you can send a request to each endpoint and check the response.

## Let the User Try It

The same way you need to try every piece of documentation your users will want
to. Give them an way to do it. Here you have many options to choose from.

### REPL

The first one (and usually harder to implement) is to add a REPL, on the ▲ZEIT
docs we decided to put a simple editor to test our most important endpoint,
`/v2/now/deployments`, which let you create a new deployment with a single API
request.

This editor let you write the code of a `package.json` and `index.js` file, see
a cURL example request and a button to deploy it with one click from the docs.

### Copy-Past Ready Code

Another option is to write ready to use code the user could copy-paste it. This
way the user can go to the terminal, code editor or IDE and run the example code
to check the results and if it works.

In our case
[we wrote an internal component](https://github.com/zeit/docs/blob/master/components/api/request.js)
to send the HTTP request data and generate a cURL code, but that same component
could generate a
[Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) code for
JS or any other possible code and let the user define his favourite language of
choice to see the example.

## Write as Much as You Can and as Less as Possible

The API documentation should be as completd as possible and that mean you need
to write a lot of example codes and text. But at the same time there's not a
single person who want to read a book to understand a single API endpoint.

This led us to try to write as less as possible and make the documentation super
simple. The simpler and completed the docs most possible the users will
understand the API and use it.

## The Design Matters

Developers tends to understimate the importances of a good design specially for
his own developments, but a good design is a _must_ for a good documentation
(and any project in general) and helps the users understand it faster.

The ▲ZEIT's designer [Evil Rabbit](https://twitter.com/evilrabbit_) did an
awesome job on each single part of the documentation UI and even helped to
decide how to organize it.

Yes, text organization is part of a good design and could be the difference
between an easy to understand API and a complete mess.

## Get a Second Opinion

Is could be easy to write the documentation and ship it, but must possible
something you can think is easy to read and understand could be actually harder.
It's always (not only for documentation) a good idea to get a second opinion.

It could be a co-worker not really working on the API docs or an external (but
trusty) person who can read it and give a valuable opinion and feedback. Don't
show it to everyone, pick the people you think will help you improve the
documentation.

## Give Hints and Tips

A simple and bored docs tell you how each endpoints works. A good documentation
give you hints and tips on how to use it better. This could be really simple
like a note or it could also explain common use cases.

This way the user will not only learn how to use your API but also what's the
best and recommended way to use it. Similar to why
[errors are important](#errors-are-important) this hints and tips could become
on less support work required for the users of your API because you're already
teaching them how to use it.
