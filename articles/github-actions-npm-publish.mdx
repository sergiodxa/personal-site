Since I got access to the new GitHub Actions version I have waited to have a
reason to use them and there was a workflow I always wanted to automate since it
was too repetitive, publish to npm.

I have multiple packages in npm, like
[flagged](https://github.com/sergiodxa/flagged) or
[@contentz/build](https://github.com/contentz-tech/build), that I wanted to
automate the publish.

## The Action

```yml
name: Publish

on:
  release:
    types: [published]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: 12
          registry-url: https://registry.npmjs.org/
      - run: yarn install
      - run: npm publish --access public
        env:
          NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{secrets.NPM_TOKEN}}
```

This code is the GitHub Action I used, let's see what it does.

```yml
name: Publish
```

First we put a name to the action, this will be displayed in the checks of each
PR or commit.

```yml
on:
  release:
    types: [published]
```

Then we configure when we want the action to run, in this case I'm saying on
each release event when it's specifically a new release publish, the
`types: [published]` is required here since releases could also be updated or
deleted, we only want to publish to npm when a new release is created
(published).

```yml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```

Then we create or job `build` and configure it to run on the latest version of
Ubuntu.

```yml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v1
  - uses: actions/setup-node@v1
    with:
      node-version: 12
      registry-url: https://registry.npmjs.org/
  - run: yarn install
  - run: npm publish --access public
    env:
      NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{secrets.NPM_TOKEN}}
```

Now we need to configure the steps of the job, this is what it does:

- Get access to the repository files.
- Install Node.js, with the version 12 and using the registry URL of npm, this
  could be changed to a custom registry or the GitHub registry.
- Run the `yarn install` command to install the package dependencies.
- Run the `npm publish` command, the `--access public` force the package to be
  public even if the name is namespaced, this command is also run with the
  environment variable `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN` whose value is a secret configured in
  the repository called `NPM_TOKEN`.

The packages dependencies are installed because I configured a `prepare` script
in the `package.json` of my package which runs the build of my module before
publishing.

## Configure the Secret

To configure the npm token secret go to
`https://github.com/$username/$repository/settings/secrets` and click on
`Add a new secret`.

![GitHub settings to configure the secrets with two secrets already configured](/static/articles/gh-secrets.png "Here click on 'Add a new secret'")

Once you click that button GitHub will show you a form to write the name
and the value of the secret.

In our case we used `NPM_TOKEN` as name, for the value let's go to
`https://www.npmjs.com/settings/$username/tokens` to get a new token.

![npm settings page on the token sections](/static/articles/npm-tokens.png "Click the Create New Token button")

Click the `Create New Token` button in this page and you will navigate to a
form.

![npm form to create a new token with the read and publish option checked](/static/articles/npm-tokens-new.png "Here check the first option, read and publish")

In this form check the first option, `read and publish` and click on
`Create Token`, this way your token will have access to publish as you.

Now you will get back to the list of tokens with your new token created and
displayed to you, copy it and go back to GitHub and add it as value.

Once you have done that you will be able to add the secret and use it in your
GitHub Actions.

## Final Words

Now you can create a new Release on your package repository and get your package
published on npm too without using any command yourself. You could even do it
from your phone!
